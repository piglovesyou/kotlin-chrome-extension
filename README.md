# üíæ Kotlin Chrome Extension
This is a sample project demonstrating how to build a Chrome extension using Kotlin 1.8 and Compose 1.3.
It has a popup view which renders HTML with Compose with a button that sends a message to the background.
The content script injects a view, then like the popup, send a message to the background.
